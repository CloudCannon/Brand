### Interface Icons
For the majority of icons we use [Googles Material Design Icons](https://www.google.com/design/icons/). Icons can take a long time to make and even longer to look good. This can often derail a small job. The icon choice should be simple if the action is clear. If the action that the icon represents is not clear then we can talk about a custom icon. A more likely scenario is that the action is too complex for just an icon.

### File Icons
Files are important to CloudCannon therefore it makes sense that they get special treatment. When extending this library of icons please consider the following:

* The HTML file is a bright orange matching the HTML5 logo. The bright orange was also chosen as an HTML file should be a prominent click target in the app.
* The folder icon is a color resembling the OSX finder folder. This is because the majority of our users at the time were using OSX.
