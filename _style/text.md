title: Text & Language
---

Text should have a hierarchy. Headings should be displayed in order, lists should be lists and tabular data should be in a table. When dealing with text there should be a max-width of about 720px. This will mean 50 to 80 characters per line. Do not make fullscreen text pages.

All text should be written with purpose. The primary goal of all text within the app is to inform. Make sure to be succinct, no one likes to read especially when it's because something hasn't worked.

[Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/writing.html) has some good guidelines around tone and language. Finally all text should be proofread and run through [hemingwayapp](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
