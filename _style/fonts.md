### Merriweather
Use Merriweather in large bodies of text. This will allow for better readability over Open Sans. Avoid using this for headings or interface elements. This font will sit in the middle ground between large fonts and small fonts.

### Open Sans
Use Open Sans for just about everything except for bodies of text. Use this font for everything in the app as there should be no large bodies of text within the interface. Any buttons or inputs will use Open Sans.

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>

### Inconsolata
As code is at the core of CloudCannon we need to ensure that code uses a monospace font. For this we choose Inconsolata which should be primarily shown on dark backgrounds in pastel colours.

<p>This is some example code. It looks fantastic in Inconsolata, at the very least it will be in a monospace font.</p>
